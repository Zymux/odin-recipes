    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <img src="./pizza.jpg">
    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        This recipe uses simple pantry and refrigerator staples and whipping up a batch couldn't be easier. 
        It is made of milk, salt, pepper, garlic, and parmesan cheese. The butter and flour serve to thicken the sauce 
        and create a rich alfredo sauce

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul><b>Sauce:</b> This pizza doesn’t use a traditional pizza sauce (one reason it’s called a white pizza) but instead, 
        you brush on a garlic and rosemary infused olive oil. All you need for it are those three ingredients – olive oil, 
        garlic and rosemary. I use fresh rosemary, but if you want to use dry, remember that dry rosemary is pretty strong. 
        You’ll only need about 1/4 teaspoon and you’ll want to make sure you chop it finely.</ul>

    <ul><b>Cheese:</b> For your three cheeses, you’ll need ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan. 
        I first fell in love with ricotta on pizza when I made this Butternut Squash and Sage Pizza. 
        And now, I really just want to put it on everything! For the mozzarella and parmesan, I like to 
        shred them myself, as they will melt better that way.</ul>
    
    <ul><b>Topping:</b> To top it off, I add just a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. You don’t need much – 
        just enough to give a little bit of a kick. (Although I have to admit that if I were making this just 
        for myself, I’d probably lay it on heavier, because I love the spice!)</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Step 1: Combine your olive oil, garlic and rosemary, and brush that on your crust that has been rolled out.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Dollop the ricotta over the top, then gently spread.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Step 5: Top with the red chili flakes.</li>
    <li>Step 6: Bake the pizza until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.</li>
